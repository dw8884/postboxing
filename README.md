#Postboxing 

This is a sample application for 
[*postboxing*](www.postboxing.com)

The app is curently in development and this sample is being created as a test for the [*One Month Rails*](www.onemonthrails.com) course. 

The finished application will be a service that allows people to have items shipped to convenient pick up locations within their own neighborhoods rather than having to miss packages from a postal service provider.
